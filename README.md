For this project, I configured Azure Sentinel, a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, and linked it to a live virtual machine serving as a honeypot. Utilizing a custom PowerShell script, I retrieve geolocation information on attackers and visualize the data on the Azure Sentinel Map. This enables me to dynamically showcase ongoing RDP brute force attacks, originating from diverse global locations. The display is organized based on the physical location of the attackers, providing a comprehensive view of the attacks' magnitude and geographical distribution.
